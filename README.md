## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- **Full Portfolio:** This repository focuses on this specific project. You can find my entire 42 curriculum 👉 [here](https://github.com/Overtekk/42).
- **Subject Rules:** I strictly follow the rules regarding 42 subjects; I cannot share the PDFs, but I explain the concepts in this README.
- **Archive State:** The code is preserved exactly as it was during evaluation (graded state). I do not update it, so you can see my progress and mistakes from that time.
- **Academic Integrity:** I encourage you to try the project yourself first. Use this repo only as a reference, not for copy-pasting. Be patient, you will succeed.

## 📂 Purpose

**Libft** is the cornerstone of the 42 curriculum. Its goal is to build a custom C library that will be used in almost every future project.

Since we are not allowed to use most standard C libraries (like `<string.h>` or `<stdlib.h>`) in our exercises, we must rewrite these functions **from scratch**.
We will learn how to create a `Makefile` to automate compilation and generate a **static library** (`libft.a`). Also, organizing code efficiently using header files (`.h`) to declare prototypes and structures.
